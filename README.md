Plant Disease detection using Convolution Neural Netwotk

I used transfer learning for better accuracy. If you don't know what is Transfer learning check this link for more info ==> https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-use-transfer-learning-when-developing-convolutional-neural-network-models/.
The transfer learning model used here is "InceptionV3". It has around 23 Million parameters. ==> https://keras.io/api/applications/inceptionv3
Data used here is a subset of kaggle's Plant Disease Dection with 2000 for training, 80 for validation and 400 for testing.
You can find the dataset here ==> https://www.kaggle.com/emmarex/plantdisease
Download the whole data set. We'll take a subset of this data and we'll divide it for train, validation and test data
